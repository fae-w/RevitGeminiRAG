# Reminder Comment (ignored by execution wrapper):
# - This script exports elements based on the 'Created By' worksharing property.
# - It CANNOT filter by creation date or the current Revit session due to API limitations.
# - It requires the model to be workshared.
# - It approximates "model elements" by excluding element types and view-specific elements.
# - Username comparison is case-insensitive.
