# --- Script Core Logic ---

# Assumption: The request is to rename the parent 'Family' element.
# The 'Type Name' used for the new family name will be the name of the *first* FamilySymbol (type) found within that family.
# If a family contains no types (unlikely for loadable families like doors), it will be skipped.

# Filter for the correct category (Family elements don't directly have a Category property like instances/types)
# We need to check the category of their types or use the FamilyCategory property if available and reliable.
# A safer way is often to collect types (FamilySymbol) and get their parent Family.
