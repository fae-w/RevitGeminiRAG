# Purpose: This script explores, but ultimately confirms the inability to directly change the Revit application window title using the Revit API.

# Based on the provided context and general Revit API knowledge,
# there is no direct API method to *set* or *change* the main Revit application window title.
# The API provides ways to get the window handle (uiapp.MainWindowHandle)
# or its screen extents (uiapp.MainWindowExtents), primarily for parenting custom windows
# or dialogs correctly, but not for modifying the title itself.
# Attempting to modify the window title using external libraries (e.g., Win32 API calls
# with the retrieved handle) is outside the scope of the standard Revit API,
# might be unstable across Revit versions, and is generally not recommended.

# Error: The Revit API does not provide a method to change the main application window title.
