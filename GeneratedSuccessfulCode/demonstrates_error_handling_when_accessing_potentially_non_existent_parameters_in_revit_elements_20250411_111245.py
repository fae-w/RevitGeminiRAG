# Purpose: This script demonstrates error handling when accessing potentially non-existent parameters in Revit elements.

# Purpose: This script iterates through all Revit elements, attempts to access a specific parameter (likely to be missing on many elements), and demonstrates error handling for the AttributeError that occurs when accessing properties of a non-existent parameter.

ï»¿# Import necessary classes

# Collect *all* elements in the model (can be very large)
# This broad collection increases the chance of encountering an element
# that does not have the specific parameter we will query.

        # Many other element types will not have this parameter.
        area_param = elem.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.ROOM_AREA)

        # THE INTENDED POINT OF FAILURE:
        # If 'area_param' is None (because the element doesn't have it),
        # attempting to access '.AsDouble()' will raise an AttributeError.
        # This is a common type of error in Revit API scripting when
        # assumptions about element parameters are incorrect.
