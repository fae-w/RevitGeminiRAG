# Purpose: This script renames specific Revit 3D views based on a defined naming pattern.

# --- Configuration ---
# Regular expression to find views named exactly "3D View {n}" where n is one or more digits.
# Assumes the actual view names are like "3D View {1}", "3D View {12}" etc.
# ^ asserts position at start of the string.
# \$ asserts position at the end of the string.
# \{ and \} match literal braces.
# (\d+) matches one or more digits and captures them in group 1.
