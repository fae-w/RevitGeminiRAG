A Revit plugin that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable natural language interaction with the Revit API.

## üìã Project Status

> **Note:** This project is a proof of concept and is not actively maintained. It is being released to the community as a foundation for others to build upon. While functional, the codebase may contain rough edges.

## üåü Key Features

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Query your Revit model using plain English
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines Revit API knowledge with Google's Gemini AI
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Get accurate answers about Revit API functionality specific to your model
- **Extensible Foundation**: Build your own AI-powered Revit tools on top of this framework

## üîç How It Works

RevitGeminiRAG creates a vector database of Revit API knowledge and combines it with Google's Gemini AI to provide context-aware responses to your queries. The RAG system enables any LLM to access and understand the Revit API in full, making it possible to interact with Revit using natural language.

When you ask a question, the system:
1. Searches the vector database for relevant Revit API information
2. Retrieves the most pertinent API documentation and examples
3. Combines this knowledge with the Gemini AI's capabilities
4. Generates a response that accurately addresses your query in the context of your model

## üîß Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- Autodesk Revit 2023 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or later with .NET Framework 4.8
- Google API Key for Gemini AI access
- Python 3.9+ (for the RAG system)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ismail-seleit/RevitGeminiRAG.git
   ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio:
   ```
   RevitGeminiRAG.sln
   ```

3. Restore NuGet packages and build the solution

4. Set up your Google API Key as an environment variable:
   - Press Win + R, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter
   - Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables"
   - Under "User variables", click "New"
   - Variable name: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - Variable value: `your-api-key-here`
   - Click "OK" to save

5. Copy the built files to your Revit Addins folder:
   ```
   C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\[RevitVersion]\
   ```

## üìä Large Files Notice

This repository does not include the large database files required for the RAG system to function. These files are:
- `python/revit_db/chroma.sqlite3` (approximately 375 MB)
- `python/revit_db/1ccb803a-3d67-4028-a8e8-35b549456170/data_level0.bin` (approximately 285 MB)

### Generating the Database Files

These files are automatically generated when you first run the plugin with a Revit model. The plugin will:
1. Extract relevant information from your Revit model
2. Create a vector database in the `python/revit_db` directory
3. Use this database for future RAG queries

The initial generation may take several minutes depending on your model complexity.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open Revit and load a model
2. Run the RevitGeminiRAG command from the Add-Ins tab
3. Enter your query in the prompt window (e.g., "How can I get all walls in this model?")
4. The plugin will use RAG to provide context-aware responses about your model and the Revit API

### Example Queries

- "How do I access all doors in this model?"
- "Show me how to create a new wall using the API"
- "What parameters are available for this selected element?"
- "How can I filter elements by their category?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- The plugin requires an active internet connection to access Google's Gemini AI
- Initial database generation can be time-consuming for large models
- Some complex queries may require rephrasing for optimal results
- The codebase is provided as-is without extensive documentation
